The goal of this project is to create a sudoku game solver. 

Ideally, I'll start small, probably creating nothing more than a couple of classes to simulate a game. Then, after I've managed to leverage a working game, I'll implement a solver.

Once I have a soduku solver, who knows what it will grow into...?

One year later, here I am trying this once more. Hopefull I can commit to this more than the first time. Testing once more. And again
